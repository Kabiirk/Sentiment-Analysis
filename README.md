Sentiment Analysis
------
Let's Take the following example
```
"This is an example of good documentation."
```
Now obviously, we can tell that this is a positive sentence because it was written as such and we can
comprehend what is being conveyed.
But this might prove tough for a machine, figuring out wether the sentence has been said in a good
way or a bad way.Sentiment Analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.
